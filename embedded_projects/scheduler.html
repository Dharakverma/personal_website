                    Before diving into the scheduler project, let's cover some background regarding schedulers and their
                    place in computing. A scheduler is a software
                    component that allows us to manage and execute tasks in a system. These
                    tasks can be anything from simple calculations to complex algorithms that control different aspects
                    of, what is typically, an operating system running on some hardware. In our case, we needed a
                    scheduler to manage the execution of different tasks on our
                    STM32 based electronic control units (ECUs) at specific time intervals. A scheduler will allow us to
                    ensure that each task is executed in a timely
                    manner, and that the system as a whole is running as specified.
                    <br><br>
                    All of our ECUs run monolithic (single) bare-metal applications. That means we are not using
                    multiple threads. Every single task must run in a sequential order, there is no user-defined
                    parallel execution of tasks at play. If we were to implement multi-threading, I could simply import
                    a middleware real-time operating system, such as FreeRTOS, which would come packaged with its own
                    real-time scheduler. Although that approach is the most logical and performance for me, it is not a
                    good solution given the fact that our team is mainly made up of younger members who have no exposure
                    to real-time systems, and would likely be discouraged by the large leap in complexity that FreeRTOS
                    would bring. Because of that fact, I decided to create my own scheduler from scratch, one where I
                    could keep the simplicity of our system in-tack but also add the much needed functionality of task
                    scheduling.
                    <br><br>
                    Before any implementation, I came up with architecture which outlined the inner workings of the
                    scheduler as well as how a user would utilize it to scheduler their task. Given the complexity of
                    this project, I decided to consult a previous manager of mine from one of my Embedded Systems
                    internships. My previous manager glady hopped on a call with me and we walked through the entire
                    architecture, implementation details, and test plan. After this much needed professional
                    consultation, I had the confidence to begin development.
                    <br><br>
                    To develop the scheduler, I used the STM32 hardware-abstraction-layer (HAL) tick timer as the clock
                    source. The HAL tick timer is a
                    system timer that generates an interrupt at a fixed interval, which is defined in the system
                    configuration. For our use case, I set the timer to generate an interrupt every 5 milliseconds,
                    which
                    provided the basis for our scheduler. The 5 millisecond number was calculated by taking our fastest
                    updating task, the CAN message updater which was required to run at least every 15 milliseconds due
                    to safety concerns, and dividing it by the magic number of 3. This 5 millisecond base number meant
                    that any future tasks which required to be run at a rate 3 times faster than our safety critical
                    task could still be supported. The likely hood of that happening was very low, but if the STM32
                    hardware supports a 5 millisecond base timer, then there is little harm in allowing support for 5
                    millisecond tasks.
                    <br><br>
                    Once I had our clock source, I implemented the scheduler itself. The scheduler was designed to run
                    on a single thread, which allowed us to simplify the code and avoid potential synchronization
                    issues. The scheduler consisted of a list of tasks, each with its own execution interval. When a
                    task was added to the scheduler, its execution interval was calculated based on the current system
                    time and the desired interval. The task was then added to the list, and the scheduler would execute
                    it at the appropriate time.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the main benefits of the scheduler is that it allowed me to schedule different tasks in our
                    system, including the control system step function, reading CAN messages, and updating system
                    status. Each of these tasks required a specific execution interval, and the scheduler ensured that
                    they were executed at the appropriate times. This allowed me to optimize the system performance and
                    ensure that each task was given the necessary processing time.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, the scheduler was a valuable addition to our system, and it allowed me to improve our
                    performance and stability. It also provided a foundation for future development, as the team can
                    easily
                    add new tasks to the scheduler and ensure that they are executed correctly. As we continue to
                    develop our system by adding new features and tasks, I am confident that the scheduler will continue
                    to play an important role.
