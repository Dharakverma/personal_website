                    The goal of the Controls System project is to design, test, and integrate a vehicle
                    control system
                    for the 2022-2023 MAC Formula Electric vehicle. The control system will allow the vehicle to be
                    operated in basic
                    driving conditions by
                    managing the following vehicle subsystems: battery management, cooling, vehicle mode selection,
                    tractive motor,
                    and vehicle dynamics. This project is specific is purposefully abstracted away from the embedded
                    system (as much as
                    possible) to
                    simplify the black box, white box, and unit testing that must occur before it is ready for
                    implementation on the
                    vehicle. The control system will be developed using
                    MATLAB and Simulink, in a model-based design. The models will be converted to C code using the
                    relevant Simulink
                    toolkit and then handed off to the Embedded Software team for
                    integration onto the relevant microcontroller.
                    <br><br>
                    The following table provides brief explanations on each of the control system modules:
                    <br><br>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Module</th>
                        <th>Overview</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Governor</td>
                        <td>The super-state machine of the entire vehicle. Computes current vehicle status, receives
                            updates from other
                            blocks, and sends commands accordingly. The Governor is responsible for controlling and
                            monitoring the Battery Monitor,
                            Vehicle Dynamics, Motor Interface, and Driver Interface subsystems.
                            Governor uses the state of each module to determine an overall vehicle status, and
                            coordinate
                            state changes between these modules.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Driver Interface</td>
                        <td>The Driver Interface module reads environment signals from the driver (eg. pedal, steering
                            input), and processes these signals for use elsewhere in the control system.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Vehicle Dynamics</td>
                        <td>The Vehicle Dynamics module is the medium between the Driver Interface, and the Motor
                            interface. It takes processed inputs from both the Driver Interface and AMK motors, and uses
                            them to calculate appropriate motor torque requests based on factors like available
                            electrical power and component temperatures.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Motor Interface</td>
                        <td>The Motor Interface monitors and controls the state of each of the 2 AMK motors. As the name
                            implies, it serves as the interface between higher level system modules and the motors.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Battery Monitor</td>
                        <td>The Battery Monitor reads the battery's three high voltage contactor states (closed or
                            open), and determines and reports if the battery is in an operating state.</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <br><br>
                Again, each of these modules is designed such that they can be white box and black box tested,
                integrated into the control system, and then the entire system can be simulated before being pushed onto
                any form of hardware.
                This architecture inherently frames the software system as modularized, with defined IO interactions and
                hidden implementations. The modularization of the architecture is the single biggest benefit that will
                pay dividends for many years to come as it provides numerous benefits that cannot be achieved with a
                monolithic system. By breaking down the control system into smaller, more manageable modules, the user
                can achieve greater flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.
                <br><br>
                Modularization allows users to build and test individual modules independently, making it easier to
                isolate and squash bugs or undefined behavior. This approach simplifies the development process and
                reduces the risk of errors. Moreover, if a specific module needs to be replaced or updated, it can be
                done without affecting other modules in the system, inherently allowing the system to work with any
                number of modules added or removed.
                <br><br>
                Modularization also enables the user to reuse modules across different projects, vehicles, or in our
                case, competition seasons, massively saving the team time and resources. Instead of developing a new
                control system from scratch, users can simply select the relevant modules and integrate them into the
                new system, or remove the redundant modules and add new ones to the existing system.
                <br><br>
                Overall, the modular design of the Vehicle Control System architecture enables current and future
                members of Mac Formula Electric to easily understand and modify the brains of the vehicle. Each module
                in the design above has a clear and well-defined function, which inherently simplifies the overall
                system design. It also allows users to quickly locate and fix issues, leading to less development time
                spent on debugging and more time spent on feature additions.
