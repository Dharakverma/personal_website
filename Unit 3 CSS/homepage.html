          Welcome to my personal portfolio! My name is Dharak Verma and I am a Senior
          Computer Engineering student at
          McMaster University. I have had a passion for software, hardware, and its integration for as long as I can
          remember,
          and I have been fortunate enough
          to be able to apply this passion through McMaster's (MAC) Formula FSAE Electric racing team. We are a
          student-run
          team working to design, build, and compete with a fully-electric, formula-style racecar.
          <br><br>
          On this website, you will find a collection of my work on MAC Formula Electric. The
          main focus of my portfolio will be on embedded software and vehicle control projects, and how they have
          contributed
          to the development of the Formula Electric vehicle. Each project will be presented in a separate tab or
          categorization, with a timeline of the work done, any hurdles encountered, lessons learned, and the final
          outcome.
          <br><br>
          The purpose of this website is to showcase my contributions and the skills I have gained while working on MAC
          Formula Electric, and to act as a portfolio for potential employers to review my work and accomplishments.
          It is also my hope that this website will be a valuable resource for current and future members of my Formula
          Electric team at McMaster, as well as for hobbyists and Formula Electric members at other universities who are
          interested in the development of our vehicle.
